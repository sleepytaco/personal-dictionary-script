# Personal Dictionary App
A simple python script to store as well as manage (add, delete, search) words and their meanings in a text file.

# Features
- Add word in the script or via command line
- Delete word from the text file
- Search and check if a word exists. If not, offers to add the word.

# Installation
```
pip install pyinputplus
```

# How it works
The script stores words and their meanings in a textfile. It uses the sys module to handle command line arguments and the pyinputplus to handle input validation.

# Motive to make this script
I often find myself writing down new vocabulary in google docs or google keep. Navigating the site and opening the right file is a tiresome process, so I figured I would make a script to manage words in a textfile.
