# Personal Dictionary App
A simple python script to store as well as manage (add, delete, search) words and their meanings in a text file.

# How it works
The script stores words and their meanings in a textfile. It uses the sys module to handle command line arguments and the pyinputplus to handle input validation.

# Motive to make this script
I often find myself writing down new vocabulary in google docs or google keep. Navigating the site and opening the right file is a tiresome process, so I figured I would make a script to manage words in a textfile.
